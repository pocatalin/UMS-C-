This is the the professor form where a teacher has 3 buttons,one for grades,that has one combo box containing 2 options,one is to add a grade where the professor selects where he would like to a add a grade to ,then he would need to pick a student from a list(only those who attend the previously selected course) then he could add their marks(or only one mark) the date being added to the database ,and the other option is to view the grades for a course that the teaches.
The Attendance button has the same functionality as the Grade ,but it only asks to pick a course and the professor will only need to insert the ids of the students.

So the last is the admin form ,here the admin can manage all the data,the buttons to add are all self explanatory .The Refresh button will refresh all the tables,the edit will take one row ,it doest matthew what take,it will take that data and make a dynamic pop up that has all the columns and the data ,a table can have fewer columns than other tables so i made it dynamic.The Save Changes will save all the data to the database,only the current table,and the remove will delete it only in the app,only after saving the changes the row will be deleted from the database.
